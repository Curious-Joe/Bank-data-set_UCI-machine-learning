This dataset has a record of 41,188 records with data gathered against 20 variables which also include data on whether the respective customer opted in for term loan or not. In this blog Iâ€™ll try to see the relationship between different variables and in the next blog will try to come up with predictive model(s) to predict which based on specified factors which customer will likely to opt in for term loan or not. I will use R to for both running descriptive analysis and building modeling purposes. All the R codes are available in the file named , 'Bank marketing data.R' and description of the data fields or variables are available in the file 'Description.txt' and full data base used for the analysis is the file 'bank-additional-full.csv'.
